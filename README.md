## Credits Matter

If you liked my work and want to use it — **please make sure to credit me**.  
I’ve poured a **lot of effort** into this, and it means the world to be acknowledged.  
Let this project live on, be reused, improved, and celebrated in years to come. ??

## Design Philosophy

**Not a flex, but...**  
This entire project runs **without any modern frontend framework** — just my own creation: **JSPA** & **JOS**.  
**dynamic URLs, seamless navigation, zero page reloads**, **custom Animations** — all handled seamlessly server-side.  

**Why take the fking hard route ? well..**  
- The more **custom** a software gets, the more it becomes damn near impossible for others to copy-paste & simply kang my work :)  
- & coming back to the main reason, I don’t play it safe — It's a choice. Tight deadlines? Bring it on. I thrive under pressure.

## You Could Improvise 
**Don’t change the design** — it’s already *perfecto* (0_-) 
If it were me, I’d enhance the project like this:

- Build a **dashboard** for [editing events](https://www.Technotsav/edit.html) via the [event.json file](https://github.com/sushant23-git/Technotsav-Website/blob/master/events.json).  
  This saves a ton of time and helps volunteers manage the event smoothly.

## Backend Wisdom

Yup, I even worked on the [backend](https://github.com/sushant23-git/Technotsav) — had a **working prototype**, but couldn’t ship it due to time constraints. Still, here’s what I’d suggest:

- Keep login/register flow **simple** — don’t go overboard with verification.  
  *Scared of bots/hackers? Use Cloudflare (OG solution).*
- Make sure the system can handle **600–1000 concurrent users** — this is **crucial**.
- For payments:  
  Use **UPI** — nobody’s pulling out credit cards.  
  1. Start with UPI opener links  
  2. Then move to a **payment gateway** — with dynamic API links carrying product info/price.
- **Track all user activity logs** — it’s a game changer.  
  Helps with disputes, analytics, and UX improvements.

## Solo Developer. 2 Weeks. No AI !!!!

Yep, this was a **solo mission** — 
Finished it in just **2 weeks**, under mad pressure, and with **zero AI help** (this was 2023, remember?).  
Pretty wild, huh?


Whoever is taking notes rn, good luck on whatever you are up to :)
